# Fix-My-Corrupt-Windows
My friend Juan Carter always has corrupt Windows files. This little program should be able to fix any issues that deal with corrupt Windows files. Nevertheless, this program works under the pretense that System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) are still working on your PC. If SFC and DISM are corrupt, then you're cooked. Anyways, run the program and then restart your PC and all should work like a charm.

## What does this program do?
This program opens up CMD as an administrator and runs a series of commands that are supposed to fix any corrupt files on your Windows machine.
